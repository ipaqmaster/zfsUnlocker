# If it fails [connectivity, SSL, Missing secret, token permission / policy]
# You'll be prompted as a last resort.

# Make sure this computer trusts the certificate/CA for your Vault.
# You can usually test this with a cURL to the https vault URL.
# Trusts will be copied to initramfs if hook used.
